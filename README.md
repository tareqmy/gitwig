Press `?` at any time in normal mode to see the full keybinding reference as a centered popup. The help overlay only handles the dismissal keys — your selection and scroll position are preserved underneath.

The selected card's border color mirrors the current operation mode:
- **Default (Muted)** — browsing the list (unselected).
- **Cyan** — browsing the list (selected).
- **Yellow** — typing into the input field during add/edit; the selected card's border turns yellow so you can see exactly which item will be replaced.
- **Red** — awaiting delete confirmation; the doomed card's border turns red.

The selected item is marked with a left-edge `▌` accent, a colored border, and bold text. In `ADDING` and `EDITING` modes the real terminal cursor sits at the end of your input so you can see exactly where the next character will land.

## 📂 Item status indicators

Each card shows a colored symbol on the right reflecting the item's filesystem state:

- `● git` — the item is a directory containing a `.git` entry (a git repository, worktree, or submodule).
- `○ dir` — the item is a directory, but not a git repository.
- `✕ missing` — the item is not a directory on this machine (doesn't exist, is a file, or isn't accessible).

For git repositories the indicator also shows compact counts for any non-zero values:

| Suffix | Meaning | Colour |
| ------ | ------- | ------ |
| `N+`   | N files staged for commit | Cyan |
| `N!`   | N files modified but not staged | Yellow |
| `N?`   | N untracked files | Muted |
| `N↑`   | N commits ahead of upstream (needs push) | Bold |
| `N↓`   | N commits behind upstream (needs pull/fetch) | Yellow |

When all counts are zero the indicator shows `● clean`. When the branch has no configured upstream, only the worktree counts appear (no `↑`/`↓`). Press `?` at any time to see the legend inside the app.

Items support `~` and `~/...` expansion, so `~/code/twig` resolves to your home directory. Statuses are recomputed only when you add, edit, or delete an item — they are not polled in the background. Press `r` to manually refresh the selected item's status if you've changed the filesystem outside the app (e.g. `git init` in a directory that was previously `○ dir`); the status bar briefly flashes `Refreshed` so you know the check ran.

## 🔍 Detail view

Press `Enter` on a selected item to open a full-screen Detail view. The detail view supports eight tabs for git repositories: **Details**, **Files**, **Graph**, **Branches**, **Tags**, **Remotes**, **Stashes**, and **Overview**.
- Press `1` to switch to the **Details** tab.
- Press `2` to switch to the **Files** tab.
- Press `3` to switch to the **Graph** tab.
- Press `4` to switch to the **Branches** tab.
- Press `5` to switch to the **Tags** tab.
- Press `6` to switch to the **Remotes** tab.
- Press `7` to switch to the **Stashes** tab.
- Press `8` to switch to the **Overview** tab.
- Alternatively, press `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` to cycle forward/backward through the tabs.
- You can also click on the tab headers directly with the mouse to switch tabs.
Press `Esc` or `q` to return to the repository list.

### Panel Layout & Navigation (Details Tab)

For a **git repository**, the **Details** tab is split into multiple rounded panels with a 40:60 width ratio on the bottom:
- **Commits (top 50%):** Lists the recent commits in the repository. If there are uncommitted changes, a special row named `Uncommitted changes` will be pinned to the very top.
- **Staging Area / Changed Files (bottom-left 40%):** Lists files that are modified, staged, or untracked. When `Uncommitted changes` is selected at the top, this panel is split vertically into `Staged` and `Unstaged` sections. When a real commit is selected, it is split horizontally, showing the list of files modified in that commit in the top half, and full commit details (hash, author, date, refs, and message) in the bottom half.
- **Staging Details (bottom-right 60%):** Displays the unified diff of the selected file.

### Files Tab

The **Files** tab displays all tracked files in the repository as an interactive directory tree on the left, and a preview panel on the right.
- Directory nodes are prefixed with `>` when collapsed and `▼` when expanded.
- File nodes are prefixed with `🗎`.
- **Expand Folder:** Select a collapsed directory and press `>` or `.` or `Right-Arrow`.
- **Collapse Folder:** Select an expanded directory and press `<` or `,` or `Left-Arrow`.
- **Preview Panel:** Selecting a file displays its content (up to 100 KB) on the right; selecting a directory displays a list of files and folders directly inside it.

### Graph Tab

The **Graph** tab renders the git log history graph / branch visualization graph.

### Branches Tab

The **Branches** tab is split vertically into left and right panels:
- **Local Branches (left):** Lists local branches in the repository, sorting the active branch to the top marked with ``.
- **Remote Branches (right):** Lists remote tracking branches.

You can focus either branch panel by pressing `w` / `W` or using the `←` / `→` arrow keys.

### Tags Tab

The **Tags** tab lists both local tags and remote tags.
- Select a local tag and press `↵` (Enter) to checkout that tag.
- Select any tag and press `d` / `D` to delete it (asks for confirmation).
- Press `p` to push the selected tag to the remote (asks for confirmation).
- Press `P` (Shift+P) to push all tags to the remote (asks for confirmation).

### Remotes Tab

The **Remotes** tab lists configured remotes for the repository.

### Stashes Tab

The **Stashes** tab lists all available stashes in the repository with a horizontally split layout:
- **Stashes (Top-Left):** Lists all stashes. Selecting a stash automatically highlights the first file in the files list. Press `d` / `D` to delete the selected stash, or `a` / `A` to apply it (both options ask for confirmation). When applying, you can toggle whether to delete the stash after applying (default is Yes).
- **Stashed Files (Bottom-Left):** Lists the files changed/saved in the selected stash.
- **Stash Diff (Right):** Shows the unified patch diff of the selected file.
- Navigate stashes or stashed files using `↑`/`k` and `↓`/`j`.

### Overview Tab

The **Overview** tab displays key repository details including resolved paths, branch upstream tracking info, configured remotes, and general status counts.

### Navigation & Interaction

You can navigate and interact with these panels in the following ways:
- **Cycle Focus:** In the Details, Branches, Tags, and Stashes tabs, press `w` / `W` to cycle panel focus:
  - **Details tab:** `Commits` → `Staged` → `Unstaged` → `StagingDetails`.
  - **Branches tab:** `Local Branches` ↔ `Remote Branches`.
  - **Tags tab:** `Local Tags` ↔ `Remote Tags`.
  - **Stashes tab:** `Stashes` → `Stashed Files` → `StagingDetails`.
  Focus defaults to the main panel of the tab when switching tabs (e.g., `Commits` on Details tab, `Files` on Files tab, `Local Branches` on Branches tab, `Local Tags` on Tags tab, `Stashes` on Stashes tab).
- **Mouse Click to Focus/Select:** Left-click inside any panel's boundaries (including branch/tag/stash list panels, stashed files list, and the files list) to focus it immediately.
- **Mouse Wheel Scroll:** Use the mouse wheel to scroll vertically through the active list, commit history, branch list, files list, stashed files list, or staging details diff.
- **Navigate Lists:** Use `↑`/`k` and `↓`/`j` to select a commit, file, branch, tag, stash, stashed file, or file tree item in the active list.
- **Scroll Diff:** When the `Staging Details` panel is focused, you can scroll the unified diff text vertically using `↑`/`k` and `↓`/`j` (line-by-line) or `PgUp`/`PgDn` (page-by-page).
- **Stage/Unstage Files:** Select the `Uncommitted changes` row at the top, select a file in either the `Staged` or `Unstaged` list, and press `Enter` to stage or unstage that file instantly.
- **Network Progress Bar:** Any long-running network operations (such as Fetch, Pull, or Push) will display a centering animated progress bar popup so the UI thread remains responsive and visual feedback is clear. If an operation hangs or takes too long, you can press `Esc` to force-dismiss the progress popup and resume TUI interaction immediately.
- **Multi-Remote Selection Picker:** For write operations (pushing branch/tags, deleting tags, fetching tags), if the repository has multiple configured remotes and no upstream tracking branch is set, a selection picker popup will appear allowing you to select which remote to target using ↑↓ and Enter.
- **Manage Branches:** While on the **Branches** tab:
  - Select any **local branch** (other than the currently active one) and press `Enter` to check it out (safe checkout strategy applies).
  - Select any **local branch** that has an upstream configuration and press `Shift+F` to fetch updates for its remote in the background.
  - Select any **local branch** and press `p` to pull updates from its remote in the background (can only pull into the currently checked-out branch).
  - Select any **local branch** and press `Shift+P` to push it to the remote in the background (if no upstream is configured, it will attempt to push to the first configured remote and set it as the upstream tracking branch).
  - Select any **remote branch** and press `Enter` to check it out (this will switch to the branch, creating a local tracking branch if it doesn't already exist).
  - Press `c` / `C` to create a new branch from the currently checked out branch (or HEAD). A popup dialog will prompt for the new branch name.
  - Select any local or remote-tracking branch and press `d` / `D` to delete it. A confirmation dialog will prompt before performing the deletion. (The currently checked out branch cannot be deleted).
- **Commit Staged Changes / Amend Last Commit:** Press `c` from the Details tab to open a centered Commit popup window (active if there are staged changes OR a prior HEAD commit exists to amend). 
  - **Compose Mode:** Type your commit message. Press `Ctrl+C` to lock in the text and switch to confirmation state, press `Enter` to insert a newline, or `Esc` to cancel.
  - **Confirm Mode:** Press `Enter` to execute the commit, `e` to return to composing/editing the message, `a` / `A` / `Space` to toggle the "Amend last commit" option, or `Esc`/`q` to close the popup. Toggling amend to active when the buffer is empty automatically populates the text box with the message from the last commit.

For a **plain directory** the view confirms the resolved path and explains that no `.git` entry was found.

For a **missing** item the view confirms the resolved path and notes that the path does not exist or isn't accessible.

The detail snapshot is taken **once** when you press Enter — it is not refreshed while open (except for staging/unstaging actions which refresh dynamically). Close and re-open to re-read the repository state.

After every successful add / edit / delete, the status bar briefly shows `Saved` or `Deleted`. If the write fails, the status bar shows `Save failed: <reason>` instead — your in-memory list still reflects the change, but the file on disk does not.

### 🔀 Main Page Sorting

The main page repository list can be sorted dynamically using shortcuts:
- **Cycle Sort Order (`o`):** Cycles through the sorting modes: `Custom` (preserves your manual list order), `Alphabetical`, `Recent Visit` (tracks when you enter a repository's detail view), and `Latest Changes` (based on HEAD commit timestamps or folder modification times).
- **Toggle Sort Direction (`O`):** Toggles ascending vs. descending/reversed sort direction. The top border displays the active sort mode (e.g. `Sort: Alphabetical (Rev)`).

## 🔧 Configuration

Twig stores its config in `~/.twig/config.toml`. The directory is created automatically on first launch.

### First-run migration

If `~/.twig/config.toml` doesn't exist yet, Twig looks for an existing config to migrate from:

1. A path passed as the first CLI argument (`twig path/to/config.toml`).
2. `./config/config.toml` relative to the current working directory.
3. `./config/config.toml` relative to the executable.
4. `~/.config/twig/config.toml` (previous XDG location).
5. Nothing found — a default config is written to `~/.twig/config.toml`.

After the first run the migrated (or generated) file becomes the sole source of truth; the original is left untouched.

### Example: `config.toml`

```toml
items = ["Repo A", "Repo B", "Side Project", "Test Repo"]

# Event-loop poll interval in milliseconds (default: 100).
# Lower → more responsive input, higher → less CPU usage. Sane range: 16–500.
poll_interval_ms = 100

# Sorting preferences for the main page list
sort_by = "custom"
sort_reverse = false
```

### Config keys

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `items` | `[String]` | `[]` | Paths shown in the main list. Managed by the in-app `a` (fzf search) / `e` / `d` shortcuts. |
| `poll_interval_ms` | `Integer` | `100` | How long (ms) the event loop waits between input checks. Lower feels snappier; higher saves CPU. |
| `sort_by` | `String` | `"custom"` | Main list sorting preference (`"custom"`, `"alphabetical"`, `"recent_visit"`, `"latest_changes"`). Managed by `o`. |
| `sort_reverse` | `Boolean` | `false` | Inverts the main list sorting direction (ascending vs. descending). Managed by `O`. |

Twig writes back to whichever file it loaded from, so edits made in the UI persist across runs.
